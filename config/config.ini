# 1. Define Road Parameters
[Road]
Road_Id = 1			# Unique Id for the simulation 
Road_Length = 40
Road_Width = 8

[Signal]
#Road_Signal = 5
Road_Position = 15

# 2. Define default params
[Default]
Default_MaxSpeed = 1 		# Max Speed per second
Default_Acceleration = 1	# Increase in speed per second
Time_Step = 250             # In milliseconds

# 3. Define params for specific vehicle types
#First letter of vehicle type should be different for distinguishing
[Vehicles]
Vehicle_Type = Car		# A new vehicle class will start with a type field
Vehicle_Length = 2,
Vehicle_Width = 2
Vehicle_MaxSpeed = 3
Vehicle_Acceleration = 2

Vehicle_Type = bike		# The first character will be used as the symbol for printing
Vehicle_Length = 2
Vehicle_Width = 1
Vehicle_MaxSpeed = 4
Vehicle_Acceleration = 2

Vehicle_Type = racer		# The first character will be used as the symbol for printing
Vehicle_Length = 2
Vehicle_Width = 2

Vehicle_Length = 3
Vehicle_Width = 2
Vehicle_MaxSpeed = 3
Vehicle_Acceleration = 1
